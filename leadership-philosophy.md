# Leadership Philosophy

These statements are a summation of concepts which, through research and experience, I have come to believe are important for building and maintaining cohesive, stable and effective teams. 

They are not objective truths, nor are they rules to be followed, but my hope is that they will give you an idea of what motivates me, and an idea of what you can expect from your interactions with me.

### :people_holding_hands: A team of high performers is not the same as a high performing team

*An inexperienced team who are willing to understand how they can learn from and support each other will ultimately out-perform a team of experienced individuals who do not engage as a team.*

### :people_holding_hands: We're all in the people business

*Technology is only useful if we understand how it solves real-life problems for our users, and we can only build solutions at scale by understanding what motivates our teammates to help us solve those problems.*

*Work should be fun, at least some of the time. Work relationships are worth investing in, beyond the minimum required for business-as-usual.*

### :office_worker: Time is our most valuable resource

*Don't spend time on anything you don't understand the value of, and don’t ask others to do anything you wouldn’t be willing to do yourself. Think critically, plan ahead, consult a diverse audience, challenge the status quo, minimise waste, and strive for continuous improvement.*

### :office_worker: Human error should never be a root cause

*Nobody works in a vacuum. If a single mistake can cause a perceivable issue, it’s usually a sign that the process is insufficiently resilient.*

*Making mistakes, then owning them as data to help improve in future, is a marker of success, not failure.*

### :office_worker: Standards set you free

*Autonomy without guardrails leads to teams being overwhelmed at the infinite available options available to them, and stressed about breaking things they are responsible for yet don’t have a good understanding of.*

### :heartpulse: Family first

*“Work-life balance” means something different to every teammate, and providing the right support often requires first investing in understanding their unique situations.*

### :heartpulse: Bring your whole self to work

*Don’t be afraid to let your personality show. Teammates are more than just their job description. Understand how your work supports your personal values and motivations, and vice versa.*

### :heartpulse: Your best work is sometimes done not at work

*In this remote-working, cross-timezone environment it can be hard to separate work and non-work, and sometimes that’s OK.*
